# Overview

As part of my journey to becoming a better software engineer, I created this project to learn and practice new programming skills. My goal is to build useful software and solve real problems while continuing to grow and learn more about different technologies.

This software is a basic Python program that demonstrates how to use simple commands, like printing text to the screen.

The reason I made this software was to strengthen my understanding of Python and create a portfolio piece that shows my progress. This project helps me learn the basics, which I can build on to create more complex projects in the future.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used:
* Development Tool: Visual Studio Code, with Python extensions for writing and testing the code.
* Version Control: Git, to keep track of changes in my code.

The programming language I used is Python because it's very powerful for creating all kinds of programs. Python is also a very good foundational language and great for when one is learning how to code for the first time.
